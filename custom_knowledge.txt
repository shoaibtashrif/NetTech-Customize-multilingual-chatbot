## 1. BISP Nashonuma Programme

The Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) is implementing its flagship Conditional Cash Transfer–based Stunting Prevention Programme “Nashonuma” to break the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition in the poorest households. Launched in August 2020 in 14 districts (and ICT), and scaled up nationwide in December 2022, it targets pregnant & lactating women and children under two, delivering a comprehensive package of nutrition and health interventions through “Facilitation Centres” embedded at tehsil/taluka/district health facilities .

## 2. Adolescent Health and Nutrition in Pakistan

* **Demographics & Context**
  Pakistan has \~42 million adolescents. Despite a demographic dividend, poverty, low female education, limited water/sanitation, and gender norms hinder adolescent health.&#x20;
* **Reproductive Health**
  Median age at first birth remains 22 years. 8 % of girls 13–19 have begun childbearing (15 % among those without education), and 39 % of first births occur in this age group. Contraceptive prevalence is just 7 % for married adolescents (13–19 years). Adolescent fertility (44 / 1 000) is among the highest globally, and maternal mortality for 13–19 year‐olds is 194 / 100 000 live births vs. 166 / 100 000 national average .
* **Nutrition Status**
  Malnutrition is the third leading cause of DALYs among adolescents. 11.8 % of girls are underweight; 11.4 % are overweight. Over half (56.6 %) of adolescent girls are anemic, with higher rates among those from poorer or less‐educated families.&#x20;
* **Barriers**
  Cultural norms limit girls’ autonomy, control over food, and use of health services; mothers often make nutrition decisions.&#x20;

## 3. Current Interventions on Adolescent Girls

There are few pilot nutrition interventions—no large‐scale programmes. Pilots focus on micronutrient deficiencies, including:

* Screening malnourished girls for anemia
* School-based WASH and menstrual hygiene management
* Biannual deworming and distribution of iron & folic acid or multi-micronutrient supplements
* Preconception care integrated into adolescent outreach

These pilots have been linked to improved school performance, energy levels and reproductive outcomes. Multi-micronutrient trials in Sindh will inform future policy .

## 4. Primary Objectives

* Contribute to reduction of anemia among adolescent girls in BISP Kafalat households&#x20;

---

## 5. Secondary Objectives

* Provide weekly iron-folic acid supplementation to 100 000 adolescent girls (13–19 years) in 6 targeted districts
* Engage adolescent girls as agents of change to influence household and community nutrition behaviors&#x20;
